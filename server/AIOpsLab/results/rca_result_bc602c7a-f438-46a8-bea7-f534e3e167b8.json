  "fault_type": "Misconfiguration",
  "reasoning": "The root cause is a Kubernetes Service targetPort misconfiguration for the `user-service`.\n\n**Evidence:**\n1. The `user-service` Service is configured with `targetPort: 9999` (verified via `kubectl describe service user-service`)\n2. However, the `user-service` pod container is actually listening on port `9090` (verified via pod spec: `containerPort: 9090`)\n3. The endpoints show the service is routing to port 9999 (`10.244.1.217:9999`), but the container is not listening on that port\n\n**Impact:**\nAny service trying to communicate with `user-service` through the Kubernetes Service will fail because traffic is being routed to port 9999, but the container is only listening on port 9090. This breaks service-to-service communication for any component that depends on user-service.\n\n**Fix:**\nThe `user-service` Service definition needs to be corrected to set `targetPort: 9090` to match the container's actual listening port.\n\nThis is a Virtualization-level issue (Kubernetes Service resource misconfiguration) with fault type Misconfiguration (incorrect targetPort value in the Service spec).",
