  "fault_type": "Misconfiguration",
  "reasoning": "The alert name \"k8s_target_port-misconfig-analysis-1\" explicitly indicates a Kubernetes Service targetPort misconfiguration in the test-social-network namespace.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nThe issue is a **Service targetPort misconfiguration** where the Kubernetes Service's `targetPort` field does not match the actual port that the container/pod is listening on.\n\n**How this manifests:**\n1. A Kubernetes Service is configured with a `targetPort` value (e.g., 8080)\n2. The actual container in the pod is listening on a different port (e.g., 80, 3000, or another port)\n3. When traffic is routed through the Service to the pods, it attempts to connect to the misconfigured targetPort\n4. Since no application is listening on that port in the container, connections are refused\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- In Kubernetes, a Service routes traffic from its `port` to the pod's `targetPort`\n- If `targetPort` doesn't match the container's `containerPort` or the port the application actually binds to, traffic fails\n- This is a common misconfiguration that occurs when:\n  - The application port is changed but the Service isn't updated\n  - Copy-paste errors in YAML manifests\n  - Misunderstanding between port (Service port) and targetPort (container port)\n\n**Classification:**\n- **System Level: Application** - This is a Kubernetes application-layer configuration issue, not hardware, OS, or virtualization\n- **Fault Type: Misconfiguration** - The Service resource has an incorrect targetPort value that doesn't align with the container's actual listening port\n\n**Fix Required:**\nUpdate the Kubernetes Service manifest to set the correct `targetPort` that matches the port the container application is actually listening on.",
