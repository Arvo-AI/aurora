  "fault_type": "Misconfiguration",
  "reasoning": "The root cause is a Kubernetes Service targetPort misconfiguration for the `user-service`.\n\n**Evidence:**\n1. The `user-service` Kubernetes Service is configured with:\n   - Port: 9090 (service port)\n   - TargetPort: 9999 (where traffic is forwarded)\n\n2. However, the user-service container is actually listening on port **9090**, not 9999.\n\n3. This mismatch means that when other services try to communicate with user-service via the Kubernetes Service on port 9090, the traffic is incorrectly forwarded to port 9999 on the container, where nothing is listening.\n\n**Impact:** All requests to the user-service will fail with connection refused errors, breaking any functionality that depends on user authentication, user lookups, or user-related operations in the social network application.\n\n**Fix:** The targetPort in the user-service Service definition should be changed from 9999 to 9090 to match the actual container port.",
